## What is ownership

Ownership is a fundamental concept in the Rust programming language that plays a crucial role in ensuring memory safety and preventing common programming errors like null pointer dereferences, data races, and memory leaks. Rust's ownership system is designed to provide both high performance and memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.

When starting out with Rust, it can be a bit foreign to make sense of the rules surrounding ownership. So lets dive in

At its core, ownership in Rust revolves around three main rules:

1. **Ownership Rule**: Each value in Rust has a variable that is its "owner". There can only be one owner for a given value at a time.
2. **Borrowing Rule**: You can have multiple references to a value, but at any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references, not both.
3. **Lifetimes**: Rust uses lifetimes to track how long references are valid. This ensures that references do not outlive the values they refer to.

Letâ€™s explore each of these rules a further along with some examples, to see how they play out in practice.



#### 1. Ownership Rule

When a value is created, its ownership is associated with the variable that holds it. When that variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the memory used by the value. This process is managed by Rust's automatic memory management system, which helps prevent memory leaks.
```rust {1-3,5} showLineNumbers  
let s = String::from("hello"); // `s` owns the string

// Ownership of `s` is transferred to `s2`
let s2 = s;

// This would result in a compile-time error, since `s` no longer owns the string.
// println!("{}", s); 
```


#### 2. Borrowing Rule
You can create references to values without taking ownership. These references can be either mutable or immutable. You can have multiple immutable references to the same data, but if you have a mutable reference, you cannot have any other references to the same data at the same time.

An example `jsx` code block.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s); // Immutable reference to `s`

    // This would result in a compile-time error since we can't have both an immutable and a mutable reference to the same data.
    // let mutable_reference = &mut s;
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

#### 3. Lifetimes

Lifetimes ensure that references are always valid and don't outlive the data they point to. They are annotations that indicate how long a reference is valid. The Rust compiler uses these annotations to verify that references are used correctly.

An example `css` code block.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r;
    {
        let r1 = &s; // `r1` is valid inside this inner scope
        r = r1;     // Valid: `r1` is no longer used beyond this point
    }             // `r` and `s` are no longer used here, so they go out of scope

    // This would result in a compile-time error because `r` is trying to reference memory that has been deallocated.
    // println!("{}", r);
}
```
